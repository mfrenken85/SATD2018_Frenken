# SATD2018
CAPITA project by Mark Frenken on SATD. The Maldonado database is needed to run this project.

## How to use
1. Extract comments from a project using srcML. Some have already been included in the the projects folder.
2. Run extract_comments.py to store in Maldonado database.
3. Classify comments manually.
4. Run classify_comments.py to check performance of the classifier.

## TODO
- Finish this readme
- Notes on how serialized classifiers are created
- Update classified comments to database?
