this seems like it should be obvious and straight-forward but when the direction vector needs to match with the notion of the dragview pushing other views we have to employ a slightly more subtle notion of the direction vector. the question is what two points is the vector between? the center of the dragview and its desired destination? not quite as this doesnt necessarily coincide with the interaction of the dragview and items occupying those cells. instead we use some heuristics to often lock the vector to up down left or right which helps make pushing feel right.
